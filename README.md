# Climate Little Picture "hot summer week"

This data visualization was my entry for the ["Climate Little Picture" visualization competition by ESA (European Space Agency)](https://climate.esa.int/en/littlepictures/) in 2023.

I used the following programming languages and tools: Python & Jupyter Notebooks for data wrangling, Svelte and D3 for visualization as well as Figma for final editing.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
